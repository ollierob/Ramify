            Hebden Bridge is a town several miles west of Halifax that sits on the confluence of the Calder River and
            Hebden Water.
            Known in medieval times as *Hepton brigge*, it was sparsely populated marshland until numerous mills were
            established on the rivers during the Industrial Revolution.
