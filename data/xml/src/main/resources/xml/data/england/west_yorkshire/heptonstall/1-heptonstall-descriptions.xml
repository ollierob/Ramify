        <description>
            St Thomas church was built before 1260 and dedicated to St Thomas a Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury
            who was murdered in 1170.

            In 1847 a storm tore off some of the roof and part of the tower collapsed.
            It was decided that a new church should be built, and a new church dedicated to St Thomas the Apostle was
            consecrated in 1854.
