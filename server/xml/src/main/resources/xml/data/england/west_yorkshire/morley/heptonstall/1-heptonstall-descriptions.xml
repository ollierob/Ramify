            The village of Heptonstall sits on the hilltop above Hebden Bridge.
            First mentioned in the 13th century, it formed part of the *rectorial* manor of Halifax-cum-Heptonstall,
            with tithes and rental income due to the monks of the Priory of Lewes in Sussex.

        <description>
            St Thomas church was built before 1260 and dedicated to St Thomas a Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury
            who was murdered in 1170.

            In 1847 a storm tore off some of the roof and part of the tower collapsed.
            It was decided that a new church should be built, and a new church dedicated to St Thomas the Apostle was
            consecrated in 1854.

            Methodism in Heptonstall can trace its roots back to the 1740s, with the establishment of Darney Societies
            and visitations by the Wesley brothers.
            An octagonal church was built in 1764 and claims to be the oldest Methodist church still in use.
